         It selects the HTML elements with the classes "wrapper", "signup header",

          It then adds an event listener to the "login header" element that listens for a "click" event.
           When the "login header" element is clicked, the "active" class is added to the "wrapper" element. 
           It also adds an event listener to the "signup header" element that listens for a "click" event.
            When the "signup header" element is clicked, the "active" class is removed from the "wrapper" element.
